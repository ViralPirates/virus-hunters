# CPL Plan - Week 2

In the second week, the students will be performing spot assays and phage purification.

## Tuesday 18th May
Students will set up four top agar spot plates, with 12 samples per plate (w. neg. ctrl).

* Students will mark plates into quadrants
* Students will add 1 mL of host culture at $OD_{600} of 0.6 to 3 mL of molten top agar (0.6% agar in LB + 10 mM $MgCl_{2}$ + 10 mM $CaCl_{2}$), vortex briefly and then pour onto bottom plate
* Once the plates are set, students will spot 5 µL of phage lysate from each sample at 3 per quadrant
* Plates will be incubated O/N at 37 °C for plaque formation

### Materials required
* 10 mL pathogen culture
* 5 glass test tubes with lids containing 3 mL molten agar (60 total)
* 5 petri dishes with bottom agar (60 total)
* water bath (or heat blocks if the tubes will fit in).

## Wednesday 19th May
Students will pick plaques and perform first round of O/N purification steps. We are going to assume a maximum of 3 phages per student.

* Students will take a photo of their plates to record plaque morphology
* For each plaque, students will core the plaque using a pipette tip and place it in 200 µL of SM buffer in a microcentrifuge tube, before vortexing briefly.
* Students will then set up a dilution series from $10^{0}$ to $10^{-11}$ in SM Buffer in a 96 well plate (one row per phage)
* Using the same method as the spot assay, students will spot the 12 dilutions onto a single plate (so one plate per phage).
* Plates will be left O/N for plaques to develop

### Materials required
* 10 mL pathogen culture
* 3 glass test tubes with lids containing 3 mL molten agar (36 total)
* 3 petri dishes with bottom agar (36 total)
* water bath (or heat blocks if the tubes will fit in).
* 1 sterile 96 well plate (12 total)
* 3 lo-bind microcentrifuge tubes (36 total)

## Thursday 20th May
From each plate, students will pick plaque from the biggest dilution (fewest phages) and perform second round of O/N purification. We are going to assume a maximum of 3 phages per student.

* Students will take a photo of their plates to record plaque morphology
* For each plaque, students will core the plaque using a pipette tip and place it in 200 µL of SM buffer in a microcentrifuge tube, before vortexing briefly.
* Students will then set up a dilution series from $10^{0}$ to $10^{-11}$ in SM Buffer in a 96 well plate (one row per phage)
* Using the same method as the spot assay, students will spot the 12 dilutions onto a single plate (so one plate per phage).
* Plates will be left O/N for plaques to develop
