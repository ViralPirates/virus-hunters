# Spot Assays and Purification

Last week, you prepared samples by enriching any phages that might be present for your pathogen. This week, we get to find out if your samples contained any suitable phages. We do this using something called a *spot assay*. Briefly, we add 5 µL of enriched viral lysate to a lawn of host culture. If there are suitable viruses present in the lysate, they will infect the cells in the lawn and start to replicate. Each round of replication releases more viruses, and a plaque begins to form, spreading outwards in a circular fashion from the initial infection. If you're interested in how plaques form, I recommend reading the paper by [@Abedon2009-zt].


## Monday 24th May

Today, we set up the first spot assay to see if we have any viruses in your samples. To make the lawn of bacteria, you need to combine an exponentially growing host with soft agar, then pour it onto a bottom plate and swirl it round for even coverage. You need to work quickly. The molten agar is above the thermal tolerance of most host bacteria, so we need to minimise the time the host spends in hot agar. Once on the bottom plate, the hot agar sets quickly, so you need to swirl quickly to get even coverage before it solidifies.

We've set up three pouring stations with water baths containing glass test tubes with 3 mL molten top agar in them. Students will come up in turn and pour their host lawns. You'll have one extra plate for a practice pour. 

- [ ] __Step 1__: Collect your plate of phage lysates from last week and a culture of your host at $OD_{600}$ of 0.6. You will also need `r ceiling((num_samples+1)/12) + 1` bottom agar plates. You'll also need to collect a microcentrifuge tube of the phage lysate for your host from the chicken sample (__C__), and a microcentrifuge tube of the phage lysate for your host from the sewage sample (__S__). 
- [ ] __Step 2__: You'll be putting 12 spots per plate (one per sample). I find the easiest way to do this is to divide your plate into quadrants, and then place three spots per quadrant. Draw two perpendicular bisecting lines on the bottom of each plate with a ruler to divide it into quadrants. Mark one edge with an arrow so we can orientate it. Label each plate with your name, the host bacterium, the date, and _Plate 1_ through _Plate `r ceiling((num_samples+1)/12)`_. Label the last plate _Practice_. On your three numbered plates, write the numbers of the samples where you are going to put them in the quadrants as shown here:

![](images/plate-layout.png)
where __B__ is where you'll put your blank, __C__ is where you'll put your chicken sample and __S__ is where you'll put your sewage sample.


- [ ] __Step 3__: Bring your labelled plates and host culture to a pouring station. We'll walk you through the process. Briefly vortex your host culture (1-2 seconds) to resuspend it. Under a blue flame, put your practice plate in front of you and take off the lid. Take the cap off of a tube of molten agar, but leave it in the water bath. Use a pipette to suck up 1 mL of host culture into a blue tip. Using the other hand, take the tube of molten agar out of the bath and add the 1 mL of culture to it. Immediately vortex the agar (1-2 seconds) to mix and pour quickly but smoothly into the centre of the practice plate. If there are any bubbles in the tube, they'll come out last, and you want to leave them in the tube. Quickly place the tube back in the water bath rack and swirl the plate to ensure even coverage of the agar across the surface. Put the lid back on the plate, but leave it with the agar on the bottom to allow the top agar to set. Slide the plate over to one side and repeat with your remaining three plates. Note the time or set a timer for 15 minutes.

- [ ] __Step 4__: After 15 minutes, collect your plates (the top agar should now be set) and take them back to your work area. Spot assays work best if the phages are added shortly after the top agar has set.
- [ ] __Step 5__: Under a blue flame, open up Plate 1 and spot 5 µL of sample from the first eleven samples of your 96 well plate, plus your blank onto their appropriate locations on the plate. To do this, gently push the liquid out of the pipette over the location, when it has formed a droplet, touch the droplet to the surface of the agar to transfer.
- [ ] __Step 6__: Cover the plate and gently slide it to one side so as not to disturb the drops (or you get long, streaky plaques). As long as it is still near the blue flame, slide the lids partially to one side to speed up drying. __DO NOT INVERT THE PLATE__. It can take 20-30 mins outside of a flowhood for a droplet to dry, so we want to leave it as long as possible. Once the droplet is dry, any phages will diffuse through the agar and find their prey.
- [ ] __Step 7__: Repeat the process with the remaining two plates and the remaining samples. As before, if you accidentally put a sample on the wrong spot, make a note of it so we can correct it later.
- [ ] __Step 8__: When the last plate is dry, slide the lids back on and invert the plates. Bring the plates to the front and we will incubate them at 37 °C overnight to allow plaque formation.


## Tuesday 25th May
Students will pick plaques and perform first round of O/N purification steps. We are going to assume a maximum of 3 phages per student.

* Students will take a photo of their plates to record plaque morphology
* For each plaque, students will core the plaque using a pipette tip and place it in 200 µL of SM buffer in a microcentrifuge tube, before vortexing briefly.
* Students will then set up a dilution series from $10^{0}$ to $10^{-11}$ in SM Buffer in a 96 well plate (one row per phage)
* Using the same method as the spot assay, students will spot the 12 dilutions onto a single plate (so one plate per phage).
* Plates will be left O/N for plaques to develop

### Materials required
* 10 mL pathogen culture
* 3 glass test tubes with lids containing 3 mL molten agar (45 total)
* 3 petri dishes with bottom agar (45 total)
