# CPL Plan - Week 3

In the third week, the students will continue their purification assays and perform DNA extractions on phage DNA


## Monday 24th May
From each plate, students will pick plaque from the biggest dilution (fewest phages) and perform third round of O/N purification. We are going to assume a maximum of 3 phages per student.

* Students will take a photo of their plates to record plaque morphology
* For each plaque, students will core the plaque using a pipette tip and place it in 200 µL of SM buffer in a microcentrifuge tube, before vortexing briefly.
* Students will then set up a dilution series from $10^{0}$ to $10^{-11}$ in SM Buffer in a 96 well plate (one row per phage)
* Using the same method as the spot assay, students will spot the 12 dilutions onto a single plate (so one plate per phage).
* Plates will be left O/N for plaques to develop
* Students will set up O/N cultures of host 

### Materials required
* 10 mL pathogen culture
* 3 glass test tubes with lids containing 3 mL molten agar (36 total)
* 3 petri dishes with bottom agar (36 total)
* water bath (or heat blocks if the tubes will fit in).
* 1 sterile 96 well plate (12 total)
* 3 lo-bind microcentrifuge tubes (36 total)
* 2 sterilins containing 10 mL LB + 10 mM $MgCl_{2}$ + 10 mM $CaCl_{2}$ (24 total)

## Tuesday 25th May
From each plate, students will pick plaque from the biggest dilution (fewest phages) and bulk it up on hosts overnight.

* Students will take a photo of their plates to record plaque morphology. These will also be used to determine approximate PFU counts.
* Students will pick plaque from the biggest dilution (fewest phages) and add it to 50 mL of LB + 10 mM $MgCl_{2}$ + 10 mM $CaCl_{2}$, amended with 1 mL of O/N host culture.
* Cultures will be grown O/N at 30 °C

The next day (Saturday), BT and team will go in and centrifuge the samples down and prepare for each phage 1 x 50 mL tubes of lysate, filtered through a 0.2 µm syringe filter. We will prepare 3 x 2 mL phage stocks in acid washed, autoclaved amber glass vials.

**200 µL of each phage filtrate will be provided to the imaging centre.**

### Materials required
* 3 x 50 mL LB + 10 mM $MgCl_{2}$ + 10 mM $CaCl_{2}$ (2L total)
* 3 x 50 mL falcon tubes (36 total)
* 3 x 0.2 µm syringe filter (36 total)
* 3 x 25 mL syringe with luer lock (36 total).
* 3 x 2 mL amber glass vials


## Wednesday 26th May
Students will test their lysate for estimating PFU and begin phage DNA precipitation

* Students will prepare a dilution series of their phages as before and spot them in triplicate across 3 plates
* Students will transfer 30 mL of lysate to a fresh Falcon tube
* Students will add 15 µL of nuclease solution and incubate at 37 °C for 30 mins
* Students will then add 15 mL of precipitant solution to each tube and mix gently by inversion
* Samples will be incubated at 4 °C O/N

### Materials required
* 10 mL pathogen culture
* 3 glass test tubes with lids containing 3 mL molten agar (36 total)
* 3 petri dishes with bottom agar (36 total)
* water bath (or heat blocks if the tubes will fit in).
* 1 sterile 96 well plate (12 total)
* 3 x Falcon tube (36 total)
* 50 µL of nuclease solution (600 µL total)
* 50 mL of precipitant solution (600 mL total)

## Thursday 27th May
Students will extract DNA using the Promega Wizard kit using [this protocol](https://cpt.tamu.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Phage-DNA-extraction-modified-Wizard-method-07-12-2011.pdf)

Depending on how many phages we isolate, we are anticipating sending two per student for sequencing, with the remaining extractions kept back for future analyses.
### Materials required
* 3 x 500 µL resuspension buffer (5 mM $MgSO_{4}$) (18 mL total)
* 2 x Promega Wizard Kits.

## Friday 28th May
Students will perform killing efficiency assays of their phages
