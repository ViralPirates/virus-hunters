## Precipitant solution
This is a ready-mixed 30% w/v PEG-8000, 3 M NaCl solution for adding to phage lysate in a 1:2 ratio precipitant:lysate (10%PEG-8000, 1 M NaCl final conc.)

1. In a sterilized 500 mL bottle add 330 mL of autoclaved MilliQ and 105 g of NaCl and dissolve.
2. Add 180g of PEG8000, cap bottle and shake.
3. Incubate bottle in a 60 Â°C waterbath for 3 hours, shaking occasionally
4. Remove and let cool to RT, shaking occasionally
5. Add autoclaved MilliQ to 600 mL and store at RT.


## Beef resuspension solution
This is based on the recipe from [@Williamson2003-fu]. For each sample of 25g:

1. To a 500 mL Duran add the following:
  - 25g of beef extract
  - 3.35g of $Na_{2}HPO_{4}\cdot7H_{2}O$
  - 0.3g of citric acid
2. Add 250 mL of autoclaved MQ
3. Add a stirrer bar
4. Mix until completely dissolved and adjust pH to 7.2
