               necessitate acquisition of suitable phages. The exclusivity of
               phage?host relations and the risk of phage resistance instigate
               a need to rapidly isolate and characterize novel phages and
               continually build sizeable phage libraries. Current methods for
               phage isolation are both laborious and time consuming, suitable
               for the isolation of a limited number of phages. The
               high-throughput screening method for phages upscales and
               organizes enrichment of phages for fast isolation and
               identification of potentially hundreds of distinct phages

               distinct phages specific for the given conditions. The
               efficiency of the method is emphasized by our screening of 200
               environmental samples, resulting in the identification of an
               abundance of unique phage species virulent to Escherichia coli,

              the evaluation of viral recovery methods suitable for subsequent
              culture-independent analyses. In this study, four elution buffers
              (10\% beef extract, 250 mM glycine buffer, 10 mM sodium
              pyrophosphate, and 1\% potassium citrate) and three enumeration
              techniques (plaque assay, epifluorescence microscopy [EFM], and
              transmission electron microscopy [TEM]) were compared to
              determine the best method of extracting autochthonous
              bacteriophages from two Delaware agricultural soils. Beef extract
              and glycine buffer were the most effective in eluting viable
              phages inoculated into soils (up to 29\% recovery); however,
              extraction efficiency varied significantly with phage strain.
              Potassium citrate eluted the highest numbers of virus-like
              particles from both soils based on enumerations by EFM (mean, 5.3
              x 10(8) g of dry soil(-1)), but specific soil-eluant combinations
              posed significant problems to enumeration by EFM. Observations of
              virus-like particles under TEM gave confidence that the particles
              were, in fact, phages, but TEM enumerations yielded measurements
              of phage abundance (mean, 1.5 x 10(8) g of dry soil(-1)) that
              were about five times lower. Clearly, the measurement of phage
              abundance in soils varies with both the extraction and
              enumeration methodology; thus, it is important to assess multiple
              extraction and enumeration approaches prior to undertaking
              ecological studies of phages in a particular soil.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Bacteriophages (phages) are the most numerous
              biological entities on Earth and play a crucial role in shaping
              microbial communities. Investigating the bacteriophage community
              from soil will shed light not only on the yet largely unknown
              phage diversity, but may also result in novel insights towards
              their functioning in the global biogeochemical nutrient cycle and
              their significance in earthbound ecosystems. Unfortunately,
              information about soil viromes is rather scarce compared to
              aquatic environments, due to the heterogeneous soil matrix, which
              rises major technical difficulties in the extraction process.
              Resolving these technical challenges and establishing a
              standardized extraction protocol is, therefore, a fundamental
              prerequisite for replicable results and comparative virome
              studies. RESULTS: We here report the optimization of protocols
              for the extraction of phage DNA from agricultural soil preceding
              metagenomic analysis such that the protocol can equally be
              harnessed for phage isolation. As an optimization strategy, soil
              samples were spiked with Listeria phage A511 (Myovirus),
              Staphylococcus phage 2638A$\Delta$LCR (Siphovirus) and
              Escherichia phage T7 (Podovirus) (each 106 PFU/g soil). The
              efficacy of phage (i) elution, (ii) filtration, (iii)
              concentration and (iv) DNA extraction methods was tested.
              Successful extraction routes were selected based on spiked phage
              recovery and low bacterial 16S rRNA gene contaminants. Natural
              agricultural soil viromes were then extracted with the optimized
              methods and shotgun sequenced. Our approach yielded sufficient
              amounts of inhibitor-free viral DNA for shotgun sequencing devoid
              of amplification prior library preparation, and low 16S rRNA gene
              contamination levels ($\leq$ 0.2‰). Compared to previously
              published protocols, the number of bacterial read contamination
              was decreased by 65\%. In addition, 379 novel putative complete
              soil phage genomes ($\leq$ 235 kb) were obtained from over 13,000
              manually identified viral contigs, promising the discovery of a
              large, previously inaccessible viral diversity. CONCLUSION: We
              have shown a considerably enhanced extraction of the soil phage
              community by protocol optimization that has proven robust in both
              culture-dependent as well as through viromic analyses. Our huge
              data set of manually curated soil viral contigs substantially
              increases the amount of currently available soil virome data, and
              provides insights into the yet largely undescribed soil viral
              sequence space.",
