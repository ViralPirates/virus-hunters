               traditionally is done either in broth cultures or in semisolid
               agar media. These two environments may be distinguished in terms
               of their spatial structure, i.e., the degree to which they limit
               diffusion, motility, and environmental mixing. Well-mixed broth,
               for example, represents the microbiological ideal of a
               non-spatially structured environment. Agar, by contrast, imposes
               significant limitations on phage and bacterial movement and
               therefore gives rise to spatial structure.",

               necessitate acquisition of suitable phages. The exclusivity of
               phage?host relations and the risk of phage resistance instigate
               a need to rapidly isolate and characterize novel phages and
               continually build sizeable phage libraries. Current methods for
               phage isolation are both laborious and time consuming, suitable
               for the isolation of a limited number of phages. The
               high-throughput screening method for phages upscales and
               organizes enrichment of phages for fast isolation and
               identification of potentially hundreds of distinct phages
               against single hosts. This enables screening of hundreds of
               samples, in multiple simultaneous setups with varying
               parameters, increasing the likelihood of isolating multiple
               distinct phages specific for the given conditions. The
               efficiency of the method is emphasized by our screening of 200
               environmental samples, resulting in the identification of an
               abundance of unique phage species virulent to Escherichia coli,
               Salmonella enterica, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas
